The project titled “Secure Authentication Module for Operating System
using Multi-Factor Authentication (Password + OTP)” demonstrates
how layered authentication prevents intrusion attempts. The solution
is fully web-based and built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it
lightweight, platform-independent, and visually professional. When a
user accesses the system, a login interface appears requesting
username and password. If the entered credentials are incorrect,
access is immediately denied and the login does not progress further.
When credentials are correct, the user is prompted to enter a six-digit
One-Time Password (OTP) generated for that specific session. The
desktop interface is unlocked only after successful OTP validation.
